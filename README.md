<summary> üí° FYI: GPU Firmware Cleanup </summary>

If you only use an **Intel iGPU**, there's no need to keep AMD or NVIDIA GPU firmware updated. Removing them can save space and upgrade time:

```bash
sudo dnf remove amd-gpu-firmware
sudo dnf remove nvidia-gpu-firmware
```

</details>

> üö´ **[CAUTION]**
> Avoid installing `docker` on a system with `virt-manager` (virtualization) installed. It can interfere with VM network connections. Consider using `podman` instead.
