<summary> 💡 FYI: GPU Firmware Cleanup </summary>

If you only use an **Intel iGPU**, there's no need to keep AMD or NVIDIA GPU firmware updated. Removing them can save space and upgrade time:

```bash
sudo dnf remove amd-gpu-firmware amd-ucode-firmware
sudo dnf remove nvidia-gpu-firmware
```

> 🚫 **[CAUTION]**
> Installing `docker` on a system with `virt-manager` (virtualization) installed can interfere with VM network connections.
